# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Goran Csonkity  

I work as a **QA Engineer** where I focus on automation, reliability, and making sure things actually work the way they should.  
Iâ€™ve also spent time in full-stack projects, so I enjoy seeing the bigger picture - not just the tests, but how everything connects together.  

## ðŸ‘€ What Iâ€™m Into  

Iâ€™m into **technology, psychology, and anthropology**, especially how people and systems interact.  
Iâ€™ve got a natural knack for putting myself in someone elseâ€™s shoes, which makes testing and spotting edge cases way more fun.  
At heart Iâ€™m a **nerd and a sporty geek** - one day Iâ€™ll be lost in Sci-Fi, the next Iâ€™m hiking or climbing.  
I like **abstract and big-picture thinking**, but Iâ€™m also big on **efficiency and streamlining** - finding the simplest way that still gets it done.  
And yeah, sustainability and problem-solving are kind of my thing, both in projects and in life.  

## ðŸŒ± Right Now  

Iâ€™m leveling up with tools like:  
- **Automation:** Playwright, Selenium, Pytest, React Testing Library  
- **Code & Tools:** TypeScript, Python, Fastify, React  
- **Ways of working:** Agile, Scrum, ISTQB foundations  

## ðŸ’¬ Open To  

- Contributing to QA / automation in open source  
- Making CI/CD smoother and less painful  
- Projects where tech and sustainability meet

## âš¡ Random Fact  

I speak **4 languages fluently**, Iâ€™m learning a 5th, and can get by in 2 more (plus a few dialects).  
Languages are kind of like debugging - each one makes you think differently.
