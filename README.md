# 👋 Hi, I’m Goran Csonkity  

I’m a **QA Engineer focused on automation and reliability, with a strong background in full-stack development and user experience.**  
I enjoy building robust testing frameworks, improving developer workflows, and making sure products are both functional and user-friendly.  

## 👀 Interests  

I’m fascinated by **technology, psychology, and anthropology**, especially how people and systems interact.  
I can easily **place myself in someone else’s shoes**, which helps me understand user perspectives and improve quality through empathy.  
Outside of work, I’m both a **big nerd and a sporty geek** — equally at home exploring Sci-Fi universes as I am on a hiking trail or climbing wall.  
I thrive on **abstract and big-picture thinking**, with a strong drive for **efficiency and streamlining** in both code and everyday life.  
Sustainability and innovative problem-solving are values I carry into both projects and personal pursuits.  

## 🌱 Current Focus  

I’m sharpening my skills in:  
- **Test Automation:** Playwright, Selenium, Pytest, React Testing Library  
- **Programming & Tools:** TypeScript, Python, Fastify, React  
- **Processes & Methodologies:** Agile, Scrum, and ISTQB best practices  

## 💞️ Collaboration  

I’d love to collaborate on:  
- Open-source QA and automation projects

## ⚡ Fun Fact  

I speak **4 languages fluently**, I’m learning a 5th, and I can also get by in 2 more plus some dialects.  
For me, learning languages is a lot like debugging — each one teaches you a new way of thinking and solving problems.
